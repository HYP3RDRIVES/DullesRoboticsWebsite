If it wasn't obvious enough, there's a good reason why i'm using the computer science club's website as a backbone for the robotics website.
I don't know how to instantiate a website, but I know how to work off a premade one. Plus, this isn't my job anyways.
I'm currently working on getting a blog post system set up, just give me some time.
