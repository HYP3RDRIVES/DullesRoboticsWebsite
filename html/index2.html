    <h2>Unfortunatly...</h2>
    This site is down temporarily.
    We also hate to be the bearers of bad news. Unfortunatly due to a mix up in the scoring
    of the FIT Pasadena District Event, our team Circuit Bizurkers #7494 has changed to a
    <strong>Statewide</strong> rank of 53. This means we are no longer qualified for the 2019
    Season, Destination: Deep Space presented by The Boeing Company. We wish all teams the best
    of luck, and also we wish you a very happy april fools! Link to normal site at the bottom.
